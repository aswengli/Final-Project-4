# Biological Question and SRA Accession Numbers

## Biological Question
**Do pseudomonas aeruginose (commonly found in hospital aquired infections) contain genes associated with antibioltic resistance? Particularly looking at Beta-Lacramases**

## SRA Accession Numbers
Sample size of 100


## Notes
-Data retrieved from NCBI SRA database.
- Sample IDs correspond to sequencing runs from different strains.
- Study aims to analyze the presence of beta-lactamases and their correlation with antibiotic resistance.
